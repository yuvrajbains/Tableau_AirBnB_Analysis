# Tableau AirBNB Analysis
This project involves an in-depth analysis of AirBNB listings in Seattle, Washington, utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle. The analysis focuses on pricing trends, geographical mapping, and occupancy insights.

### Part 1: Data Linking and Average Price by Zipcode
The first step involved linking multiple datasets through an inner join. After combining the data, I computed the highest average price of AirBNB listings, sorted by Zipcode, to identify areas with the most expensive listings.

Part 2: Geospatial Visualization
Next, I created a geographical map to visualize where the higher average values of AirBNBs are located across Seattle. This map helps to better understand pricing distribution across different neighborhoods.

Part 3: Seasonality and Revenue Insights
I analyzed the seasonality of bookings to determine the periods when AirBNBs generate the most revenue. As expected, the data indicates that summer is the busiest and most profitable time for AirBNBs in Seattle.

Part 4: Price Analysis by Number of Bedrooms
By estimating the average cost of an AirBNB categorized by the number of bedrooms, the data confirms that more bedrooms generally lead to higher prices.

Part 5: AirBNB Listings by Bedroom Count
Lastly, I examined the distribution of AirBNB listings by the number of bedrooms. One-bedroom listings are the most common in Seattle, reflecting the demand for smaller, more affordable spaces.

Conclusion
This analysis of Seattle AirBNB data revealed valuable insights into pricing, location trends, and occupancy patterns. High-value AirBNBs tend to cluster in specific zip codes, with demand peaking during the summer months. As expected, properties with more bedrooms command higher prices, though the majority of listings cater to smaller groups with one-bedroom accommodations. This project demonstrates the power of Tableau in visualizing complex datasets, offering key takeaways for property owners, potential investors, and travelers alike.
