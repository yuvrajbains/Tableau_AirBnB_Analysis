# Tableau_AirBNB_Analysis

This was a rather large dataset from Kaggle containing information about AirBNB's in Seattle, Washington. 
The first part involved linking the datasets together by means of an inner joint. 
Then computed highest average price of an AirBNB sorted by Zipcode.

The second part involved mapping the data so its easier to visualize where the higher average value of an AIRBNB is.

Third part was figuring out when the AirBNBs are busiest or in other words when would they generate most revenue in a year. Clearly Summer seems like a good time to be in Seattle!

Estimating the average cost of an AirBNB categorized by bedroom. No surprises here. More bedrooms = More money.

Finally counting the number of AirBNB listings by bedrooms. 1 Bedroom seems to be the most popular.
